# AKL-cleaning-roster-updated

## Intro
  - Used by the Alpha Kappa Lambda, Alpha Zeta Chapter to randomly assign house cleaning jobs
  - Originally coded in Java in 2020, re-coded in Python in Summer of 2021 with extended functionality
  - Author: Thomas Bryant - tbry3467 on GitHub

## New Features
  - Produces monthly output instead of weekly output
  - Members will no longer get duplicate jobs several weeks in a row (no dupes in 1-month period)

## Running the code
  - Download the Python file and run it using your favorite IDE
  - Paths to input and output file will need to be changed to fit your system's pathing
